# Screenshot Instructions

To add a screenshot to the project:

1. Run Yamori with a test configuration:
   ```
   yamori --yamori-config tests/configs/tests.toml
   ```

2. Take a screenshot of the TUI interface showing test results

3. Save the screenshot as `screenshot.png` in the `docs/` directory

4. The screenshot will be automatically displayed in the README.md file

Note: This file is just a placeholder. You should replace it with an actual screenshot image file named `screenshot.png`.
